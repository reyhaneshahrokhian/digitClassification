# MNIST digit classification

* ### Handwritten Digit Recongnition:
   + Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits.
* ### The MNIST dataset
   + The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
* ### This project:
   + In this mini project I have done a digit classification task using MNIST dataset(2000 images for training and 500 images for validation). I have created a simple model using only one linear layer.As shows in reports, the model have good accuracy.
